## General Info
What this project aims to do is to give Beginners and Intermediate Volleyball players an all in one resource place for anything volleyball related. The reason that I chose to make this my project is because I really wanted to give back to the volleyball community and find a way to help everyone improve in some way. When I first started playing volleyball I found that finding videos/content about volleyball was really difficult as I had to scramble to find realiable resources in improving my gameplay and game knowledge. I made this website in mind to help beginners like myself, have a place to have all those resources already sorted and available for everyone, while also being able to find new places in their city to play at, while also potentially in the future to be able to talk to experienced players that are willing to help coach and improve their gameplays.
